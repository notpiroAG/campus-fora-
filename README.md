my submission for the web task
this code is only the html and css written on vs code with only yt reference(no chatgpt)
there are boxes created as per shown in the format. and.......ig i hadn't done anything more than that now :|
so due to my 3 quzzes on staurday i only managed to watch html and few css videos :(
writitng this whole took me quite a long time as this was my first so called webpage but i happy that i atleast completed it even its just a print of the format you send without any logic 
so, finally just wanted to say that i really wanna get in this project as i am going to take the web dev project in ACA too, i assure you that will not effect to my dedication towards this project 
anyways .......
