my submission for the web task/n 
this code is only the html and css written on vs code with only yt reference(no chatgpt)/n 
there are boxes created as per shown in the format. and.......ig i hadn't done anything more than that now :|
so due to my 3 quzzes on staurday i only managed to watch html and few css videos :(
writitng this whole took me quite a long time as this was my first so called webpage but i happy that i atleast completed it even its just a print of the format you send without any logic /n
so, finally just wanted to say that i really wanna get in this project and i can assure you that i will try my best in this project /n
